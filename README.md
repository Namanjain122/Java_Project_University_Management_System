The University Management System is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline and automate various administrative processes within a university. It serves multiple stakeholders, including students, faculty, and administrative staff, by providing a centralized platform for managing academic and operational activities.

Key Components
User Authentication:

The system features a login mechanism for different user roles, such as administrators, students, and faculty members. This ensures that sensitive data is protected and that users can only access information relevant to their roles.
Student Management:

The system allows for the registration and management of student records, including personal information, course enrollments, attendance, and academic performance. This module helps track student progress and facilitates communication between students and staff.
Course Management:

Administrators can create, update, and delete courses offered by the university. This module includes information about course schedules, credits, prerequisites, and faculty assignments, ensuring that all relevant data is easily accessible.
Attendance Management:

Faculty members can record and monitor student attendance, helping to ensure accountability and academic integrity. This feature can also generate reports for review by administrators and faculty.
Fee Structure Management:

The system includes functionalities for setting up and managing the university's fee structure. Administrators can define different fee categories, track payments, and generate reports related to fee collections.
About Us Page:

The application features an "About Us" page that provides information about the university, its mission, vision, and values. This serves as a point of reference for prospective students and stakeholders.
Utilization of HTML, CSS, and Java:

The front-end is built using HTML and CSS, ensuring a user-friendly interface that is responsive and visually appealing. Java serves as the back-end technology, handling business logic and database interactions.
Database Integration:

The system uses a MySQL database to store all relevant data, ensuring data integrity and security. The database is accessed through Data Access Objects (DAOs) that encapsulate database operations, making it easier to manage data interactions.
